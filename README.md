# stFI_geometrical
This repository contains MATLAB source codes for Shogo ASAHINO's master thesis project.
The goal of the project is to make an software for electromagnetic wave computation 
that works for a general input of spatial mesh information, based on the geometrical
formulation of the space-time finite integration method.
